# Universal Recoil Control System (U-RCS)

U-RCS is a powerful tool designed to assist gamers in managing weapon sprays effectively. By allowing users to map out weapon sprays with plotted points, U-RCS generates smooth curves for use in various gaming software, enhancing accuracy and precision in shooting games.

## Features
- **Intuitive Interface**: U-RCS features a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of mapping out weapon sprays.
- **Bezier Curve Generation**: The program automatically generates smooth Bezier curves based on the plotted points, ensuring precise control over weapon recoil.
- **Invert Mode**: Toggle invert mode to see the finished product & to save the curve coords to a txt file.
- **Fullscreen Support**: Enjoy a distraction-free experience with fullscreen mode, providing ample space for plotting and analyzing recoil patterns.
- **Export Functionality**: Save plotted points and generated curves for later use in other gaming software or analysis.

## How to Use
1. **Plot Points**: Use your mouse to plot points on the grid to map out the weapon spray pattern.
2. **Generate Curve**: Press the spacebar to generate a smooth Bezier curve based on the plotted points.
3. **Adjust Settings**: Toggle invert mode or switch between fullscreen and windowed mode as needed.
4. **Export Curve**: Save the generated curve along with the plotted points for use in your favorite gaming software.
